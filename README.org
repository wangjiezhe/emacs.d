* My Emacs Configuration

** Package System

I use [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]] and [[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][pallet]] to manage my packages.

- *Cask*: easy to manage dependencies.
- *pallet*: create and synchronize Cask file with Emacs's default package system automatically.

** Usage

First, install cask, Using
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
#+END_SRC
This will install =Cask= in =~/.cask/=. Then add =~/.cask/bin= into =$PATH=.
After that, clone the repo, and then use command =cask install= in the directory.

Personal informations can be customed in =rc/rc-defaults.el=.

That's it!
